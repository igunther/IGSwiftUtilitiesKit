## Getting Started

### 1. Define your keys:

```swift
enum AppKeychainKeys: String, IGSwiftKeychainKey {
    case someSecret
    // Add more keys as needed
}
```

### 2. Initialize `IGSwiftKeychain`:

```swift
let keychain = IGSwiftKeychain<AppKeychainKeys>(service: "YourAppName")
```

### 3. Basic Usage

```swift
do {
    try keychain.save("valueToSave", for: .someSecret)
} catch {
    print("Failed to save to keychain:", error)
}
```

do {
    let value = try keychain.get(.someSecret)
} catch {
    print("Failed to retrieve from keychain:", error)
